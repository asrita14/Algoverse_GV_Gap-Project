How much did she earn?", "reference_answer": "10", "gold_cot": "Weng earns 12/60 = $0.2 per minute.\nWorking 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $10.", "metadata": {"source": "sample", "difficulty": "easy"}, "model_answer": "To find Weng's earnings, we need to calculate her hourly rate for 50 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 50 minutes is 50/60 = 5/6 of an hour. Multiply this fraction by her hourly rate: (5/6) * $12 = $10."}
